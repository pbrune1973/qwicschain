# Open QWICSchain
Open QWICSchain - The enterprise-friendly, Java EE based blockchain and smart contract platform for financial services. Learn more on https://qwicschain.com

Please first read the published research paper describing QWICSchain in more detail:

* Brune, P. (2019). [Do We Really Need Another Blockchain Framework? A Case for a Legacy-friendly Distributed Ledger Implementation based on Java EE Web Technologies](https://www.scitepress.org/PublicationsDetail.aspx?ID=CGG/onaYuSE=&t=1). In Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Web Information Systems and Technologies - Volume 1: WEBIST, pages 301-306.

The directory OpenQwicsChain contains the sources and everything else in an Eclipse project. QWICSchain has been developed and tested using PostgreSQL and the OpenLiberty application server.

For building and running OpenQwicsChain, you need to dowbload and add the following Jars and add them to the WEB-INF/lib folder of the Eclipse project (they are FOSS, but not included or redistributed here due to there different licenses):

- CoDec-build21-jdk13.jar
- groovy-2.5.5.jar

Flexiprovider's Jar is still re-distriobuted here, as its original website by TH Darmstadt seems to be not online anymore, so it is hard to find these days on the internet. Please note that it may be used under a different license as OpenQwicsChain itself!
